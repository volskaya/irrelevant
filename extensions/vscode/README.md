# 🎨 Irrelevant

Irrelevant is a theme generator that produces neon-themed color schemes for development environments. The themes use an accent color and gray tones to highlight relevant code and de-emphasize irrelevant objects.

These themes don't adhere to the typical rainbow colors other themes usually use.

_This is just a read-only repository for VSCode extensions. Actual work is done in [Irrelevant](https://github.com/volskaya/irrelevant)._
